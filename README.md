# Supermarket-Together-Item-Pricer
A simple Python script to use with the game "Supermarket Together", where it is easier to keep track of item names, original market prices and the suggested new price for each item.

A JSON file is created for the data, if you want to look at the list inside of the JSON file. However, this script ALSO allows you to view it in a list within the terminal using Python.

** THIS SCRIPT WILL ONLY WORK ON PYTHON 3x **

You must also have a Python IDE installed, as this is only a text based script / program. This will be updated later once I learn how to code GUIs.
